Key Features
ðŸ”¹ Guild Chat Enhancements

    Replaces standard /guild chat with a custom chat window for improved visibility and usability.
    Chat Window is has some Themes to select from, default Theme is the "Your Custom Theme" which
    can be customized with color selectors and your Theme is persistent, saving selected colors
    as they are set. A bunch of fonts to choose from makes guild chat easy to read for us older
    gamers ;) 
    The chat appears in an Edit Box frame, put simply you can copy paste from this chat window
    an advantage over in game chat that can be helpful for copying names/links/info etc...
    Chat can be saved and cleared to free up some memory, ChatHistory is where all saved chats
    appear, and can be accessed by typing /ogch or pressing the save clear button.
    Plan on adding a KB limit to alert user when it's a good time Save & Clear. 

ðŸ”¹ Guild Management Tools

    Macro integration for easy rank and time based pruning for Officers and above.
    Member Search, look up players quickly find rank and status, online green, offline red
    The Member Search also includes a handy function that will find Unicode chars. with normal input
    ie. Search: Oldman  Result: Ã–ldman-Lightbringer  Initiate  Offline(1d 23hr) 
    Plans for timed data collection to intelligently update guild information.

ðŸ”¹ OldGods Mail Manager

    A robust system to create a blacklist of unwanted mail items to help
    combat mail grief. If you ever get 1000 BlackSmith hammers in the mail
    or any item for that matter you can easily return them to sender.
    Shift+Click support for quick item addition to the blacklist database.
    just set focus where prompted for Item ID and shift click an item then click Add
    Styled List with item textures accompanied by Item name, easy remove by clicking
    the X button beside each entry. Build a list of items and check the select all
    box, and any mail containing any of those items will be returned to the sender.
    Limitations, can not pick out items from a mail that contains blacklist attachments
    and due to Blizzards very understandable limitations to automation if you have 100
    skinning knives grieved to you, you have to click Return 100 times, which only
    takes seconds compared to opening each mail and manually returning each one.
    Future UI enhancements to match the selected Theme aesthetic, and positioning info.
    Plans to make this a stand-alone AddOn, fast relief from mail grief.
